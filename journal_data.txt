Today is violent, even through all the interactions are of people smiling, I feel the violence of people on my physical body and this is why I am angry and I do not participate or entertain their behavior (focus on non-intellectual activities). Feeling violence, meaning agitated, on your body for reading and writting is NOT OK.

When I go onto job boards, I notice that the type of jobs for my profile drasically change constantly. One week there will be only jobs of category A, and the next there will be jobs for only category B. Filling out a form/job application is important because it is proof in writting that one is applying for the correct job. Talking to people/recruiters about vauge jobs is not a reliable way to find one's correct job, in my opinion. The job application form protects workers so they know exactly what type of job they are applying for, and it labels them as their correct job, and that then labels them in society, and with who and who they can associate. Applying for the correct job protects people in their lives because society knows their intentions and accomplishments; society helps thoses who are honest and try to be responsible. If a job recruiters can not talk about or say one's "Real" job title immediately, and needs to keep it a secret, then the job environment is not correct.

Some people are not allowed to speak certain languages because it allows for a connection where people may act irresponsable, or cause unforeseen harm. It would cause people to get hurt, so some people can not participate in exactly the same way as others, who do not have their same experiences. For this reason, the people learning the new language can only do non-risky and serious things, until they have enough experience to keep interactions intelligent and correct.

Note : the audio run journal is helping me to address ideas such that my life is directed to obtaining a job with my education. I am un employed for years, floating through space wasting my "potentiel life with social interactions". The audio run journal allows me to say 'no' to things that I do not want in my life, and 'no' to ways that I do not want other people to treat me. It also allows me to question and talk out things that make me angry, sad, concerned.  It is how I am doing self-respect and self-improvement for my life.

Like I already thought, there are real life structures that help educate children and adults. Individual professionals do not need to "save" people or children, so they have a future/better careers. Individual professionals need to continue to learn and make new things with all the accumulated knowledge that they tiredlessly learned themselves, machines are powerful because they use accumulated knowledge to organize information. "Throwing away"/preventing an experienced/knowledged person from learning and advancing in a career is like never building the LLM, a machine of accumulated knowledge, or throwing machines in the garbage. People interpreting people's careers as if the best people in the field are saveurs. And they need to lead the children to the future and sacrifice their own lives and careers to "save" people/children. Note: interpreting people's lives as messages like people try to interpret stuff in religious books

The usage of keywords/acronyms can be very dangerous if used incorrectly in people's lives. The other day I was working on RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption to make a secure database using the GitHub API, I was trying to encrypt private user information in a public GitHub repository such that user information would be unread able and thus safe. I also learned that RSA has a lot of other ancroynms, including the name of social services (Revenu de Solidarie Active), Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion, Rehabilitation Services Administration, and much more. The world is becoming more and more connected with AI, imagine if AI did not make the Transformer and more complicated algorithms to correctly identify people's data with respect to a context, people would be falsely identified with many incorrect activities that would unjustly diminish or improve one's life. I think using acronmys hide truth and justice of real-life affairs, and I perfer to only use the long full names instead of acronyms. For years, in an attempt to improve my memory I started reading and trying to memorize the full names of acronyms, and no longer use acronyms. I was not consciously aware of the impact of not using acronyms on my life, but I think my life is clearer, I have a better memory of what the words mean, and I feel more intelligent because I can say the real word instead of some letters. Using acronyms is a cruch and makes one less good at speaking, writing, and understanding, just like shortening real words in chat/text messaging. Shortened words/acronyms appear to diminish intelligence and cause injustice in terms of AI.

Families are curious, they are extensions of one's self. For individuals without a strong career path, it can be difficult to know how much one should shape their life after familiy members's lives or create a personal life path for themselves. Often times, people unconciously "follow"/shape their lives after the strongest person and/or family member that they know.  This is a complement to the person that has strong career ambitions that has become strong in their life, but at the same time it causes people with less ambition to loose themselves completely in another person's life. I think it is good to be inspired by the success of others, but it is not healthy to copy/follow someone's life without considering one's own interests and strengths.

Idea from a person that tries to have self-respect and respect for others... non-violence

When one deems people not "good enough" for what ever reason, you are "ran over by a bus/truck" (you have a tramatic life experience) and you loose your things/self. If you come back from loss... I guess you run after or are always behind "the bus" that ran you over (for me it is literal to remind me of my loss of my job, social status, education). The bus is a metaphorical word that means that one can be crushed again and all one's things can be taken away again. The bus means that one's perceptions are in "the game" of desperate life competition and you have to be smart. For some people it might be exciting, but for me it means useless agression, poor ideas, anger, and never being with interesting people related to my job or having a better life. Being in the life "game" with the "bus" is not interesting...it is better when I do not notice it.

The meaning of saying "sorry" constantly in western society implies pity. Excessive pity turns into condescending cruel behavior. All excessive emotional behavior turns into cruel behavior. Constantly saying "sorry" means that people constant think that one is pitiful, thus people create events and responses that make the usage of "sorry" to be contextually true; thus causing one's life to be indeed sorrowful. Constriving events and responses to make the person's life conform to a large majority of people repeatedly saying the word "sorry", for whatever reason it started. I think that society allows 'viral word' propagation events because statistically a large number of votes is the honest truth, thus if a lot of people say "sorry" there MUST be a reliable reason that they say it, statistically.  However there are exceptions to this rule, sometimes a large group of people saying a word does not mean anything, or repeating words could have cultural implications that should not be translated literally. No one needs propagation of 'viral words' in their life that do not reflect their life, no one needs condescending pity in their life because people compare them to other more successful people and thus say "sorry" to them for not being as successful. If one wants to respectfully transform excessivly saying "sorry" in western society, perhaps one can say "thank you for a new perspective, that one can not yet understand". Thus if unexpected events happen that cause someone to say "sorry", they can replace the "sorry" with "thank you for a new perspective" and both parties will not have damaged societal reputations if the words are excessively repeated (ie: 'go viral').

People try the best they can to be responsable. Expectations of other people's lives can harm people, and it seems most responsable to just let people live and try the best they can to succeed. Pity for someone's life only makes their life worst, normal participation with someone is responsable.

Judgemental rejectance and acceptance to NOTHING. When people judge you constantly, it may seem like they are vetting you for acceptance to join something. They would give me the impression that, "maybe" you could join this job/life opportunities that does not exist yet. After 50+ 'maybes', the 'maybes opportunities' became condescending, as if the person in question (myself) constantly needs to be tested and judged for acceptance and rejection. After experiencing the 'maybe' experience I learned that in reality, people themselves are accepted to activities because of their individual work and efforts, not because someone else accepts them. If you work at something, you eventually become that something and thus acceptance to be that something. For years, there has been a feeling that I was judged to continue to do research, but in reality it was just people looking at what I did and them judging me, without any intention to employ me. People did these things simply because they could see my data, whether it be on LinkedIn or my blog. Like, 'viral words' (ie: saying sorry excessively)  can slander a person's reputation, excessive judgemental rejectance and acceptance to whatever can slander one's reputation and thus significantly influence short-term and long-terme success. People who have more in their lives think differently than people who have less in their lives. People who have more, talk about things that could be possible as if they had control and power to do it because they do have some power (a position, job, money, contacts, etc). They make promises as if it was nothing, and if the promises are not fulfilled it does not damage their reputation. People who have less must use all their resources effectively (time, money, their 'word'/ensuring they keep all their promises). They do not have time to talk or waste on idle chit chat that earns them nothing in life. Be normal, be responsable, be respectful of other people and yourself. Life goes on with or without you. Life goes on, and it is not mean.

The audio journal is "equivalent to confiding to someone", except one can go back and look at how one was thinking and learn from one's self instead of burdening other people around them with their life complaints. Physically speaking about one's problems/annoyances is healthy, because other wise one carries around "unprocessed emotional bagage" that cause one to make poor decisions or emotionally stay in a negative stuck state.

People do not make money for a reason. It either means that they are not associated with the correct group of people, such that the people see their contributional benefit. Or, it could mean that the person is not respected such that others do not beleive that they should be compensated for their efforts/contributions, like everyone else whom is compensated for the same endeavors. For this reason it is important to say "how they want to be treated in society". If individuals do not intellegently inform others how they wish to be treated in society, people/society will treat them with respect to the socital events and their lives will be sweep away.

If you are acting angry and mean, change your way of thinking and do not participate in meaness/violence. Nothing is accomplished with angry and mean thinking, it wastes people's lives and time. Controlling people's things means you take away their human rights. The beliefs of large groups of people give meaningless things meaning. People give their own meaning to controlling other people's things, but controlling other people means taking away someone's human rights. That is why people collaborate in responsable realites, so people can deicde for themselves and their human rights are not taken away. When intelligent/educated people come to a space of violence and lack, they can either participate (get 'swept-away') with the violence-thinking or remain the same and transform the space into a fair, safe, and intelligent space. Just because you come into a space that needs developement, it does not mean that you "sacraficed" thus you have nothing to do or that you can participate in an irresponsible manner. Participating in a "space of developement" means that one needs constant self-improvement and self-mastery to understand one's self and others around them who are experiencing difficult decision making situations. One needs to uplift and transform the space into a fair and intelligent place by being the best version that one can be.
