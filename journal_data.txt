Yeah, one thing that made me follow the data science craze was that it was beautiful. It was beautiful to be flawless like a robot. It was beautiful to think that you were a robot in some way. That you were flawless. You could type fast. The ideas could come to you so quickly. You could visualize any complex situation in a way that was inhuman. And it was beautiful. And I think that's why a lot of people tried hard to have the level in data science. And to follow everything so fast and perfectly like robots. Because it was beautiful to try to be like a robot. And a lot of people felt disappointed when they slowly didn't get the things that they thought they should get. And then they stopped. A lot of people said, I followed and I followed. And I just stopped. But it was beautiful. And that's why they followed in the first place. It was beautiful to code fast. It was beautiful to think like a robot. And that's why a lot of people coded. A lot of people made things that were amazing. And you need the beauty in things to do hard things. Thank you.

The usage of keywords/acronyms can be very dangerous if used incorrectly in people's lives. The other day I was working on RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption to make a secure database using the GitHub API, I was trying to encrypt private user information in a public GitHub repository such that user information would be unread able and thus safe. I also learned that RSA has a lot of other acronyms, including the name of social services (Revenu de Solidarie Active), Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion, Rehabilitation Services Administration, and much more. The world is becoming more and more connected with AI, imagine if AI did not make the Transformer and more complicated algorithms to correctly identify people's data with respect to a context, people would be falsely identified with many incorrect activities that would unjustly diminish or improve one's life. I think using acronyms hide truth and justice of real-life affairs, and I prefer to only use the long full names instead of acronyms. For years, in an attempt to improve my memory I started reading and trying to memorize the full names of acronyms, and no longer use acronyms. I was not consciously aware of the impact of not using acronyms on my life, but I think my life is clearer, I have a better memory of what the words mean, and I feel more intelligent because I can say the real word instead of some letters. Using acronyms is a crutch and makes one less good at speaking, writing, and understanding, just like shortening real words in chat/text messaging. Shortened words/acronyms appear to diminish intelligence and cause injustice in terms of AI.

Families are curious, they are extensions of one's self. For individuals without a strong career path, it can be difficult to know how much one should shape their life after family member's lives or create a personal life path for themselves. Often times, people unconsciously "follow"/shape their lives after the strongest person and/or family member that they know.  This is a complement to the person that has strong career ambitions that has become strong in their life, but at the same time it causes people with less ambition to loose themselves completely in another person's life. I think it is good to be inspired by the success of others, but it is not healthy to copy/follow someone's life without considering one's own interests and strengths.

Difficult tasks are easier when there is beauty.

People do not make money for a reason. It either means that they are not associated with the correct group of people, such that the people see the benefits of their contributions. Or, it could mean that the person is not respected such that others do not believe that they should be compensated for their efforts/contributions, like everyone else whom is compensated for the same endeavors. For this reason it is important to say "how they want to be treated in society". If individuals do not intelligently inform others how they wish to be treated in society, people/society will treat them with respect to the societal events and their lives will be sweep away.

If you are acting angry and mean, change your way of thinking and do not participate in meanness/violence. Nothing is accomplished with angry and mean thinking, it wastes people's lives and time. Controlling people's things means you take away their human rights. The beliefs of large groups of people give meaningless things meaning. People give their own meaning to controlling other people's things, but controlling other people means taking away someone's human rights. That is why people collaborate in responsible realities, so people can decide for themselves and their human rights are not taken away. When intelligent/educated people come to a space of violence and lack, they can either participate (get 'swept-away') with the violence-thinking or remain the same and transform the space into a fair, safe, and intelligent space. Just because you come into a space that needs development, it does not mean that you "sacrificed" thus you have nothing to do or that you can participate in an irresponsible manner. Participating in a "space of development" means that one needs constant self-improvement and self-mastery to understand one's self and others around them who are experiencing difficult decision making situations. One needs to uplift and transform the space into a fair and intelligent place by being the best version that one can be.
