# text_2_chatbot_journal

The intention of this application is to demonstrate a Productivity application for better everyday responsible self-help. Being active in life means that one is taking action, and learning by reflecting on the responses in their life due to their activity. By recording or writing ideas in a journal, self-discovery and better decision making can be fostered to have a "Happy and Healthy Life". The purpose of this webapp is to create a **chat-bot personal journal** or **digital twin**, compiling both audio and text, such that better self-awareness and responsibility can be acheived. 

Chat-bot technology used in a self-transformative manner can be the start of a new type of self-therapy that perhaps could be used to help people to:
1. better solve their problems,
2. be less violent with themselves and others,
3. have more self-respect and respect for others,
4. be more responsible such that everyone can have a positive future,
5. and live a happier and healthier life.

Input text data and/or other data into a journal, train a chatbot with the journal data, ask the chatbot questions about the journal data for better self understanding.


[Version where text file is read from repository] https://codesolutions2.github.io/text_2_chatbot_journal/index.html
The journal_data.txt file contains a handful of my own journal entries for public sharing to demonstrate this digital twin webapp; the majority of entries are audio transcriptions that were recorded throughout the day or during exercise. Therefore, creating a digital journal of ideas (digital twin) is not a difficult or time-consuming task. Audio files can be transcribed to text, and the text can be used to train a chatbot or digital twin of one's self, such that one can learn about one's self and thus make better decisions.

[Version where text file is upload - anyone can use their data with the application] in progress
